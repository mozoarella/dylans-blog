## Hello again
I've never been the best at keeping up with blogs, which does explain dipping for about 7 months. I've started writing posts, but I've never managed to complete them in one go and by then usually my interest in the subject is gone. 

Actually quite a bit has happened for me project-wise, I had started on a project called B2 (Brain2) for documenting knowledge. But it turns out it's quite difficult to just dump everything out without thinking about it too much.  I have however started working on [Tibby](https://github.com/TibbyRocks/Tibby) for which I've learnt quite a bit about Go as a whole, and how to implement translation APIs. So Tibby currently is mostly a "Translate stuff to English"-machine, but that's useful and good. 
Tibby, as in the character in my head which is based on a Tibetan Fox, has also inspired me to dabble in game design.

Well I say dabble, I haven't actually *done* anything yet apart from some world building and I have purchased a pixel art tool (are you proud of me yet?).
