## Dylans.blog

This repository contains the full source code and content for dylans.blog.

The website can be generated with the static site generator Hugo. You should use the extended version later than v0.83.0 as I make use of both SASS and WebP processing.

Now deployed through GitHub actions.

Command for local development here for my own reference `hugo server --bind 0.0.0.0 --baseURL https://blog.homedev.dy.lan --tlsAuto`
